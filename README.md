<h2>Welcome to Booktrade git repository.</h2>

Booktrade, as it says, it is platform for trading books where users trade books for books or anything they want. In booktrade books are strictly in physical form as its focus is to find physical form books from different sources. 

At first Booktrade was aimed for students who couldn't find relevant books for their education but now it's aiming for every person on earth who likes reading books.

<b>Booktrade is ONLY HTML/CSS based software.</b> It does not include any kind of script language. It contains various features as mentioned below:

1. Register and Login service (I can see your password in database, Will improve later)
2. Sending messages to users (In website, after viewing book press on send proposal to deliver a message to uploader/// Messages are not encrypted so be careful of what you write)
3. Administrative tools.(Delete users or their books)
4. A library that shows all the books registered 
5. Book uploading (Only inforamtion about the book you hold, not the book itself)
6. Edit the information about the book.

This is not an actual commercial project so cut it some slack. There are some security issues that I haven't considered yet nor that I've decided to. <i>Feel free to contribute and improve it. Just make sure you dont push script language in it(Javascript or jquery).</i>
